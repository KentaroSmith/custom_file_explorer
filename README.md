Goals:

File explorer for basic operations:
 - Show current directory
 - Show Path at address bar
 - Show files
 - Show creation date
 - Allow files to be opened or moved from window

Nice to have:
 - Multiple tabs, similar to a web browser
 - bookmarks 
 - gauge showing storage space available of certain drives
 - Progress meter of data transfer
 - custom icons for file/folder types (font awesome with material theme?)
 - default dark mode
